## Decentralized Todo Application

Ola, Welcome to my decentralized todo app repo.ðŸ˜€ The DApp is deployed here [Todo DApp](https://decentralized-todo-app.web.app/). Make sure your wallet is connected to Ropsten Test Network.
<hr/>

Things to consider before adding and developing on this repo.

- Make sure you've installed âœ”âœ”âœ”
`@truffle/hdwallet-provider`, `chai`, `chai-as-promised`, `dotenv`, `web3`
These packages are used to test, develop and deploy smart contract to Ropsten Test Network.
  First navigate to my main folder i.e. todo-app/ the simply type `npm install` to install the package, dependencies.

* Don't forget to add .env i.e. environment file to the parent directory and your `API_KEY` from any backend i.e. for contract in my case I've used `alchemy api` and add the `MNEMONIC` from your wallet specifically the mnemonic of address i.e. has account on ropsten test network.
  <br/><b>Note</b>: `Do not share your API or MNEMONIC with anyone else.`

- Do not config the truffle-config until you know what you're doing. If in case of deploying in local chain, Ganache GUI and CUI uses different port so you can change that simply it'd be either 7545 or 8545.

This much might be enough to manipulate my contracts and if you want to work on frontend part navigate to client directory and read the documentation.
