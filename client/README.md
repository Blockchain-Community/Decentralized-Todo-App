## Welcome again to my frontend side of Decentralized Todo Application built on top of ethereum deployed on Ropsten Test Network.ðŸ˜€
<hr/>

Things to consider before manipulating the app.
* Add your backend api in `API_KEY` in App.js on line 34. I've used `alchemy api` but you can use any one i.e. `infura`, `ipfs` etc.
* Add your contract address where the contract was deployed. If you deployed but don't know the contract address then visit etherscan and search with your public address the transaction will be there in chain.
<hr/>

### How the app is functioning?
* Required data are fetched in App.js using asynchronous function inside the useEffect() hook.
* `Home` component is used as a layout in this project.
* Simply form and list is used to add, retrieve the contract data.
* I again repeat all the functional things are inside App.js including adding the todo item to blockchain using async function.
